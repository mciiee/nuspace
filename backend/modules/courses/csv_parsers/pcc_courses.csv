8235,LING 789,,,,PhD,SSH,"The course provides an introduction to Discourse and Grammar – an interdisciplinary branch of language study comprising research from typology, syntax, interactional linguistics, and cognitive science. The course takes Discourse and Grammar as the label for a unified field which looks at discourse from the perspective of grammar, and grammar from the perspective of discourse. The Discourse and Grammar approach is interested in finding functional explanations behind the emergence of grammar. Discourse is understood as the domain of language use, with speakers making functional choices at all levels of structure, whether across sentence and larger unit boundaries, inside clauses and phrases, or even within words. Grammar provides the structures for linguistic action, and functionally motivated linguistic action in turn produces the recurrent patterns that ultimately grammaticize, giving rise to linguistic structure. The course will cover the two major directions of the interface between grammar and interaction: (1) how grammatical structures arise from fluid patterns of language use (discourse); (2) how stable structures of grammar provide templates for linguistic action. Research questions in the domain of Discourse and Grammar can be addressed through a variety of methods, including quantitative (corpus linguistics, psycholinguistics experiments) and qualitative (Conversation Analysis, discourse analysis, structural analysis).","Languages, Literature and Linguistics",Discourse and Grammar,8,Spring 2026
